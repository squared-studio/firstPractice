# How to cook chicken

Cooking chicken is very hard. I never ever cooked chicken. becouse it is very hard. however, I can tell you how to cook chicken. All you need to do is to follow the following steps one by one:

- ## Step 1: Kill the chicken
I know, it sounds brutal, but there is no ther way. Tigers kill deers to survive. Cats kill mouse to survive. Fish kill fish to survive. So, we also have to kill checken to survive. I know, some people in China cook live anaimals. But it is Haram. So, don't forget to kill the chicken before cooking.

- ## Step 2: Peel off the skin
The skin of chicken is covered with lots of feathers. It is very troublesome to pluck out the feathers. So, why not peel the skin itself? Who loves the skin anyway? I don't know how it tastes like. But it looks very "Yuck-yuck" to me. So, don't you dare to cook the chicken's skin!

- ## Step 3: Cut it into several peices
Cut the chicken into several peices so that it doesn't reassmle in your tummy and lay eggs. If it lay eggs in your tummy, your tummy will ache and you will end up Resting in Peace forever.

- ## Step 3: Merinate the chicken
Chicken is very yummy. But without spices, it will taste very tasteless. So, if you want the chicken to taste yummy, don't forget to merinate the chicken with chilli powder, salt, garlic, and some other spices. If you don't know what i mean by "some other spices", just buy the "Radhunui Chicken Mix" or ask your mom.

- ## Step 4: Cook the chicken in high heat
It will take a very long time to cook the chicken in low heat. We don't have much time. So, just cook it in high heat. 


Finally, your chicken will be ready to eat. Don't forget to wash your hands before eating. Keep washing your hands until the smell of raw chicken in gone from your hands. If the smell doesn't go, eat with fork and knife. You better wear gloves next time!!!
